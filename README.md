1a) The symbols for arithmetic operators are:

2a) Examples of Arithmetic operators: 
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y; // z will be 15

let a = 10;
let b = 3;
let c = a % b; // c will be 1

2b) Examples of Assignment operators:
let x;
x = 5; // x will be 5

let y = 10;
y += 3; // y will be 13

2c) Examples of Comparison operators:
let x = 12;
if (x > 9) {
  console.log("x is greater than 9");
} // the answer is true

let y = 9;
if (y <= 6) {
  console.log("y is less than or equal to 6");
} // the answe is false coz y which is 9 is not less than or equal to 6

2d) Examples of Logical operators:
let x = 7;
if (x > 5 && x < 10) {
  console.log("x is between 5 and 10");
}   // the answer is true 

let y = 12;
if (y < 5 || y > 10) {
  console.log("y is less than 5 or greater than 10");
}    // the answer is true 

2e) Examples of Bitwise operators:
let result = 5 & 3; // result is 1

let result = 5 | 3; // result is 7

4) The result of the program is 1, 8 and 15.
